1.	The sourcecodes of computation project are supplied in CONet directory
2.	Due to historical reasons the project contains also the system that allows to administrate the collected data with the help of MySQL database engine.
3.	Due to size of raw method runs and results it generates the data contains only summary files with the comparisons. Nevertheless all data might be supported on request
4.	Due to historical reasons, the project is made in Visual Studio 2008. Some of the sources are relatively old, so sorry for the eventual inconvenience
5.	RunMeYourself folder contains a compiled exe file, the settings file, and the data necessary to run an experiment. Note, that the settings files may require some additional settings on their end, since some new options were added to the method. These options were unavailable when the research was performed. The exemplary settings file shows how to supplement the settings files to successfully run experiments on your own.
